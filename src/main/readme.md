# **Problem domain**

As a team, we are basically working on the problem domain of the group chatting App. To be more specific, it’s an app 
that specializes in collaborative work and communication tools
, whose functions include project management, team collaboration, 
communication optimization, etc. Our focus is to utilize 
different kinds of APIs, including but not limited to  Baidu 
translation API, and JavaMail API,to combine multiple group working
assisting tools within a single app, which helps maximize the working 
efficiency of teams in various areas. Furthermore, we are trying to 
create some accessibility options designed to support users with 
intellectual disabilities. The actual implementation of our project 
is going to help us dig deep into ways of writing various codes to 
interact with multiple APIs, in order to accomplish different tasks,
and it’s a concrete example of Clean Architecture.


# **Description of our Application**

<h3>Project Description:</h3>

Our team plans to develop an online collaboration application for
efficient and productive working purposes with following
functions(temporary):


-   **Chatting**: Users can chat with their friends online.




-   **Data storage**: After each conversation, our application will save the
    data automatically and then store it into local memory.




-   **Translating**: Our application can translate between different
    languages.




-   **Change voice into text**(if applicable) : If our team can achieve the
    voice input functionality, then we are aiming that our application
    is able to change it into text.




-   **Summarization**: When one conversation or online meeting is finished,
    our application can summarize the content and then record it in
    local memory.




-   **Interactive job lists**: Users can easily distribute marked todo jobs
    with interactive functions to individuals or groups.




-   **Notification function**: Group leaders or managers may publish
    notifications to chat rooms with email reminders.




-   **Accessibility options**: We offer functions like picture-to-text,
    picture description, text-to-speech and color blind mode to
    support workers with intellectual disabilities.




-   **Polling function**: Leaders or members may enable anonymous polls to
    gain authentic voting results.




-   **Files sharing**: Files can be submitted to sharing cloud space so that
    telecommuting has become more convenient.
